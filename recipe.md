Mash the peeled & de-seeded chikoos, using an electric blender or mixie.
In a bowl, combine Nestl√© MILKMAID, fresh cream and chikoo puree. Whisk until the mixture thickens. Set it in freezer till half set. Remove and whisk again until smooth. Doing so will help keep the texture of the ice cream soft and creamy while it sets.
Return to freezer and set completely. Serve chilled.
